                    <p class="article-information">
                        Duct Cleaning TipTop Ltd adheres to the TR19 standard, developed by BESA (Building Engineering Services Association), which defines industry best practices for ventilation system cleanliness. This certification isn’t a formality—it’s a legal and operational necessity for restaurants, commercial kitchens, and food facilities across the UK. TR19 ensures that kitchen extract systems are cleaned and maintained to a measurable and auditable standard, reducing fire risk, improving airflow efficiency, and safeguarding health and safety.

                        Our team conducts all cleanings in strict compliance with TR19, from canopy to fan. Every service is supported by full documentation and audit trails. TR19 certification is your defense during Environmental Health Officer (EHO) inspections and insurance audits, offering proof that your premises meet UK regulatory standards. Failure to comply can invalidate insurance policies and result in costly enforcement actions. With Duct Cleaning TipTop Ltd, you remain protected and inspection-ready.

                    <p class="article-information">
                        At Duct Cleaning TipTop Ltd, transparency is part of our process. Every TR19 cleaning is documented with high-resolution before-and-after photos, clearly showing what was done and the measurable difference our service delivers. Our engineers use photographic evidence to visually record the condition of the system pre-clean and the results post-clean, covering: <strong>Kitchen canopies, Extraction ducts, Fan units, Grease Filters.</strong>
                        Each photo set is timestamped and included in the final compliance report to serve as verifiable evidence during audits. This eliminates ambiguity and reinforces accountability.

                        Clients consistently remark on the professionalism of our documentation—images are not just for internal records but form a critical part of your compliance pack. You receive a digital portfolio of the service, which not only protects your establishment during inspections but also demonstrates due diligence to insurers, fire authorities, and facility stakeholders. With our detailed reporting, you can prove without doubt that your ventilation hygiene meets the TR19 standard.

                        Following each service, Duct Cleaning TipTop Ltd issues a TR19 Certificate of Cleanliness, accompanied by a comprehensive service report tailored to your premises. This certificate outlines: <strong>

                            Methods and equipment used,
                            Cleaning schedule recommendation,
                            Engineer signatures and verification,
                            Image evidence and ductwork schematics (if applicable). </strong>

                        This document holds significant weight during environmental health inspections, fire safety reviews, and insurance evaluations. By working with us, your business demonstrates a proactive commitment to compliance, operational safety, and hygiene standards.

                        Restaurants and food preparation facilities face increasingly strict scrutiny—our certification acts as an official shield. In the event of a fire or contamination incident, the TR19 report proves that your business took all reasonable steps to mitigate risks.
